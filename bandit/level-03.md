## Level 3 to Level 4

## Goal
Find and read a hidden file inside the `inhere` directory. It holds the password for the next level.

## Concept
In Linux, files and directories that start with a dot (`.`) are hidden by default. A normal `ls` skips them, so you need a specific flag to show them when listing a directory.

## Commands Used
`ssh`, `cd`, `ls -a`, `cat`

## What I Did
I logged in with `ssh` and moved into the `inhere` directory with `cd`. Running `ls -a` revealed the hidden file that a plain `ls` had skipped. I then used `cat` with the file's full name to print its contents.

## What I Learned
Linux hides files whose names begin with a dot, and `ls -a` reveals them. It taught me to look more thoroughly when a directory appears empty.
